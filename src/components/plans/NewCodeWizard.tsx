/**
 * Picking a city, spelled the way the app spells it.
 *
 * Two problems with a plain text box. The city on a promo code is
 * compared to profiles.city as lowercase text, so "Bengaluru" and
 * "Bangalore" are the same place and two different codes — one of which
 * silently reaches nobody. And a typo is invisible: the code saves, the
 * list shows it, and it simply never matches.
 *
 * So the suggestions come from Google, restricted to localities, which
 * is the same lookup the app uses when it fills in somebody's city.
 * Asking the same source is what makes the two strings match.
 *
 * The cities members are already in are shown first and need no call —
 * those are both the likeliest choice and the only ones known to have
 * anybody in them.
