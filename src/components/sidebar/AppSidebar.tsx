/*
 * One rail.
 *
 * There were two, and the reason was real at the time: twenty-eight
 * destinations did not fit in a single column on a laptop, and a nav you
 * have to scroll is the one thing on a screen that should never need it.
 * Splitting them by kind — what you *watch* on the left, what you *set*
 * on the right — at least made the split memorable.
 *
 * Merging the pages settled it. Twelve destinations fit in one column
 * with room to spare, and two rails were costing more than they bought:
 * a quarter of the window given to chrome, the content squeezed into the
 * middle, and every screen asking which side a thing lived on before you
 * could look for it.
 *
 * The old split survives as the grouping below — watched things first,
 * then the things you set — separated by rules rather than by distance.
