/**
 * Reload when a table changes, without polling.
 *
 * Every page here loaded once on mount and then sat there. A member
 * signing up, a report arriving, a ticket being answered — none of it
 * showed until somebody pressed refresh, which meant the panel was
 * usually describing a database that had moved on.
 *
 * This subscribes to Postgres changes and calls the same loader the
 * page already has. It deliberately re-runs the whole load rather than
 * patching the changed row into local state: the loaders here join,
 * count and aggregate, and a page that reconstructs those by hand from
 * a change payload drifts from the query it is supposed to mirror.
 *
 * Reads go through the panel's own routes with the service role, so a
 * table invisible to the anon key still loads correctly — this only
 * needs to know that *something* changed, not what.
 *
 * Note the tables must be added to the `supabase_realtime` publication
 * or nothing arrives. Migration 058 does that.
