/**
 * The compatibility engine, from the outside.
 *
 * Two questions this page answers and nothing else can: is any given
 * question worth asking, and does the score actually separate people.
 *
 * A dimension answered by 8% of members is phrased badly or asked too late.
 * A distribution bunched above 80% means the weights are too generous to
 * distinguish anyone, and every match looks equally good — which is the same
 * as no matching at all.
 *
 * Individual answers are deliberately not here. Reading what one named
 * person said about jealousy or money is not moderation.
 *
 * Two subjects share this screen, and they were stacked with nothing
 * but a divider between them. The page called itself "Compatibility"
 * and said it was about sign-up questions — then, below the fold,
 * carried the pass cooldowns, the daily exposure cap and the new-member
 * boost, none of which are questions. Somebody looking for the fairness
 * settings had no reason to look here, and somebody reading the
 * dimensions table had a wall of unrelated fields under it.
 *
 * They are tabs now, and the page is called Matching, which is the one
 * word that honestly covers both.
