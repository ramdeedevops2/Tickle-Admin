/**
 * Roses, in one place.
 *
 * The currency was administered from six screens: packs on /plans, drop
 * and extend costs on /hearts, the revival price and the media-save split
 * in fairness settings, founding grants on /cities, referral and mission
 * rewards elsewhere again. Each of those screens owned a different half
 * of the same decision — how many roses exist, and what they buy — and
 * nobody could see the tank while turning a tap.
 *
 * The rose fields **moved** here; they were not copied. A setting
 * editable in two places is a setting with two answers.
 *
 * There were seven tabs, and all seven read one /api/roses response —
 * so they were never saving a request, only hiding data already
 * fetched. Worse, they split things that are only meaningful against
 * each other: Packs said what is for sale and Purchases said what
 * actually sold, two tabs apart. Overview was a summary of Earning and
 * Spending, which made it a third place to look at the same numbers.
 *
 * Three now, by the question being asked:
 *
 *   Money    — what is sold, and what sold. Packs plus purchases.
 *   Supply   — how roses enter and leave, and the summary of both.
 *   Records  — what happened to one person's roses. Ledger plus grants,
 *              which belong together because granting some is followed
 *              immediately by checking the ledger to see it worked.
