/**
 * Read any table the panel is allowed to read, with the service role.
 *
 * Once RLS is on, every one of these tables answers a signed-in admin with
 * their own rows and nothing else — which for a moderation panel means six
 * pages that render empty. The panel is not a member; it needs to see across
 * everyone, and that is exactly what the service role is for.
 *
 * This is a read hatch, not a general query endpoint. Three things keep it
 * from becoming one:
 *
 *   1. An allowlist of tables. Nothing outside it is reachable, so adding a
 *      table to the database does not silently expose it here.
 *   2. Reads only. No insert, update or delete — those live in the specific
 *      routes that know what they are doing and can log it.
 *   3. requireAdmin on every call, same as everywhere else.
 *
 * Without the allowlist this would be a way to read auth.users through a
 * query parameter, which is the sort of endpoint that ends up in a
 * post-mortem.
