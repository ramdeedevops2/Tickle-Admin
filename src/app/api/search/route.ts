 * One query, every table worth searching.
 *
 * The palette could find pages and members, and nothing else. Everything
 * else in the database — the café somebody dropped a heart at, the scam
 * pattern with a typo in it, the promo code from last month, the job
 * title that needs a synonym — could only be found by remembering which
 * screen owned it and searching there.
 *
 * That is the wrong way round. Somebody typing "kulcha" wants the venue
 * wherever it lives; making them first recall that venues are under
 * Places is asking them to know the panel's filing system before they
 * can use it.
 *
 * Read-only, and through the service role because RLS scopes most of
 * these to the signed-in member. Every result is a pointer at a screen
 * that already knows how to show and edit the thing — nothing is
 * editable from here.
