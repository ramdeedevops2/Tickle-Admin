/*
 * Seed demo profiles around Mohali / Chandigarh / Panchkula.
 *
 * Written against what discovery actually requires, which is stricter
 * than "a row in profiles". refresh_discovery_pool() only considers a
 * candidate with coordinates, a name, published_at set, a compatible
 * gender pair, and activity inside fairness_settings.dormant_after.
 * Miss any one and the profile exists but never appears in a deck,
 * which is the failure mode worth avoiding here.
 *
 * profiles.user_id references auth.users, so each one needs a real auth
 * user. A trigger creates the profile row on signup, so this updates
 * rather than inserts.
 *
 * Every seeded account is marked: email @tickle.seed, and seed:true in
 * the draft column. That is what makes them findable and removable
 * later, and it is the difference between demo data and litter.
